## The Problem
This is a APi that i am developing to provide information about walks and trials in New Zealand (with help of a udemy course)

## My problem Solving
My aprouch is rather simple but effective with just 7 steps:
    1: Define the problem.
    2: Identify possible causes.
    3: Brainstorm options to solve the problem.
    4: Select an option.
    5: Create an implementation plan.
    6: Execute the plan and monitor the results.
    7: Evaluate the solution.
    
this helps me solve big problems very easily.
